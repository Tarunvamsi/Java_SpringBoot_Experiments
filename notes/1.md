## JDK , JRE, JVM

### JDK - To compile the java code

- why we need a Java Development kit ?
- When we write a readable code we need to compile to byte code

### JVM - Which runs the code

    - Space where we run the byte code in java virtual machine
    - Makes java platform independent as we haad extra virtual layer
    - fina;;y we need JVM to run code

### JRE - Java Run Time Environment

    - Checks all the classes and imported libraries
    - Ultimately JVM is importsnt
    - any extra files that we need will provide by JRE

- JRE is the part of JVM
- Without JRE we dont have JVM
- JVM is inside JRE

- (1)JDK -> (2)JRE -> (3)JVM

- main -> it is a method when says the start of execution 
- Actual dev of any product or software we will create modules
-  All modules come together as software
-  in java we create components with classes
-
